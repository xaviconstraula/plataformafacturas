# User Authentication Migration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to implement user authentication and the migration process for existing data.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Schema Updates (prisma/schema.prisma)

#### Added User Relations to Core Entities:

**Provider Model:**
- Added `userId: String` (required)
- Added `user: User` relation
- Added index on `userId`

**Material Model:**
- Added `userId: String` (required)  
- Added `user: User` relation
- Added index on `userId`

**ProductGroup Model:**
- Added `userId: String` (required)
- Added `user: User` relation  
- Added index on `userId`

**User Model:**
- Added relations: `providers: Provider[]`, `materials: Material[]`, `productGroups: ProductGroup[]`

#### Notes:
- `BatchProcessing` already had optional `userId` field
- `Invoice`, `InvoiceItem`, `MaterialProvider`, `PriceAlert` are linked through their parent entities
- All relationships use `onDelete: Cascade` for data consistency

### 2. Migration Scripts Created

#### Primary Migration Script: `scripts/migrate-data-to-user.ts`
- Assigns all existing data to a specified user
- Uses database transactions for safety
- Provides detailed progress logging
- Includes automatic verification

#### Helper Scripts:
- `scripts/list-users.ts` - Lists all users to find correct user ID
- `scripts/rollback-user-migration.ts` - Rollback script for emergency use

#### Package.json Scripts Added:
- `npm run migration:list-users` - List all users
- `npm run migration:migrate-to-user <userId>` - Run migration
- `npm run migration:rollback --confirm` - Rollback migration

### 3. Documentation Created
- `scripts/MIGRATION_README.md` - Detailed migration guide
- This summary file

## Migration Process

### Step 1: Database Schema Migration
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name "add-user-relations"
```

### Step 2: Find Target User
```bash
npm run migration:list-users
# or
npx tsx scripts/list-users.ts
```

### Step 3: Run Data Migration
```bash
npm run migration:migrate-to-user <USER_ID>
# or  
npx tsx scripts/migrate-data-to-user.ts <USER_ID>
```

## Data Ownership Hierarchy

After migration, the ownership hierarchy is:

```
User
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Providers (owned by user)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Invoices (linked through provider)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ InvoiceItems (linked through invoice)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MaterialProviders (linked through provider)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PriceAlerts (linked through provider)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Materials (owned by user)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ InvoiceItems (linked through material)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MaterialProviders (linked through material) 
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PriceAlerts (linked through material)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ProductGroups (owned by user)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Materials (linked through product group)
```

## Security Implications

### What This Enables:
- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant data isolation
- ‚úÖ User-specific data filtering
- ‚úÖ Proper authentication/authorization
- ‚úÖ Data ownership tracking

### What Needs to Be Updated in Application Code:

1. **API Endpoints**: Add user filtering to all queries
2. **Components**: Filter data by current user
3. **Forms**: Associate new records with current user
4. **Analytics**: Scope analytics to user's data

### Example Query Updates:

**Before:**
```typescript
const providers = await prisma.provider.findMany()
```

**After:**
```typescript
const providers = await prisma.provider.findMany({
  where: { userId: currentUser.id }
})
```

## Verification

After migration, verify by checking:

1. **All providers have userId:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Provider" WHERE "userId" IS NULL;
   -- Should return 0
   ```

2. **All materials have userId:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Material" WHERE "userId" IS NULL;
   -- Should return 0
   ```

3. **All product groups have userId:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "ProductGroup" WHERE "userId" IS NULL;
   -- Should return 0
   ```

4. **User owns expected data:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     u.email,
     COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) as providers,
     COUNT(DISTINCT m.id) as materials,
     COUNT(DISTINCT pg.id) as product_groups
   FROM "user" u
   LEFT JOIN "Provider" p ON p."userId" = u.id
   LEFT JOIN "Material" m ON m."userId" = u.id  
   LEFT JOIN "ProductGroup" pg ON pg."userId" = u.id
   GROUP BY u.id, u.email;
   ```

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

1. **Immediate rollback (removes user assignments):**
   ```bash
   npm run migration:rollback -- --confirm
   ```

2. **Full schema rollback:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate reset
   # Then restore from backup
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Update Application Code:**
   - Add user context to all data operations
   - Update API endpoints for multi-tenancy
   - Modify UI components for user-scoped data

2. **Test Migration:**
   - Verify all data is accessible
   - Test user isolation
   - Confirm no data loss

3. **Update Documentation:**
   - API documentation
   - User guides
   - Development setup instructions

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified:
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added user relations
- `package.json` - Added migration scripts

### Created:
- `scripts/migrate-data-to-user.ts` - Main migration script
- `scripts/list-users.ts` - User listing helper
- `scripts/rollback-user-migration.ts` - Rollback script
- `scripts/MIGRATION_README.md` - Detailed guide
- `scripts/MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Important Notes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Always backup database before running migration
- ‚úÖ Migration is idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- ‚úÖ Uses transactions for data consistency
- ‚úÖ Includes comprehensive error handling and logging
- üí° Test in development environment first
